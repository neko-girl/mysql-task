I bring an abundance of cuteness and charm to the GitHub world. When I'm not napping or enjoying delicious treats, I enjoy exploring the world of programming or drinking at the bar.

# My Interests
🌸 Sleeping: I can nap for hours and wake up feeling refreshed and ready to sleep!
🍣 Eating: I have a weakness for tasty treats, especially sushi and fish-shaped pastries.
💖 Cuddles: Nothing makes me happier than having my little belly caressed and receiving lots of love and affection.
🌈 Kawaii Culture: I'm a huge fan of all things kawaii, from adorable plushies to colorful accessories.
⭐ Beautiful: I am the most beautiful being in my entire university and possibly from China.

# My Skills
💻 Programming Languages: I'm fluent in the language love and code but my relationships don't last longer than a week, including purrfect knowledge of Python, JavaScript, and Docker.
📚 Continuous Learning: I'm always curious and eager to learn new technologies and expand my skillset beacause I dont have opcions if I wanna follow living in China.
🗣️ Languages: I am a polyglot who can speak Chinese, English and Spanish, but I cannot understand people and their irrational emotionalism.
